This page serves as a tutorial to illustrate the creation of a web map which displays WMS files.

# Installing Docker

We will be running our geoserver in a container on a Docker container. You can find an open-source version of Docker (which should run on any modern PC) at [this github link](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases).

1. Download the .exe file from GitHub
2. Run the .exe file. There will be a prompt to allow an Oracle driver to install; click yes.
3. You should have Docker Toolbox installed.

I can't help but think that we don't have enough bike infrastructure outside of Downtown, but whatever.
